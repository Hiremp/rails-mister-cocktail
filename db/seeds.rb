# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# db/seeds.rb
# puts "Cleaning database..."
# Cocktail.destroy_all

# puts "Creating cocktails..."
# mojito = { name: "Mojito" }
# bloody_mary = { name: "Bloody Mary" }
# sex_on_the_beach = { name: "Sex on the beach" }
# margarita = { name: "Margarita" }
# pina_colada = { name: "Pina Colada" }

# [mojito, bloody_mary, sex_on_the_beach, margarita, pina_colada].each do |attributes|
#   cocktail = Cocktail.create!(attributes)
#   puts "Created #{cocktail.name}"
# end
# puts "Finished!"
